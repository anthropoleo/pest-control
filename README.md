# Pest Control Company Website

This project was created for a friend who is launching a pest control company. It provides information about the services offered, contact details, and other essential business information. It's a free project that was done in a few hours.

## About the Project

This site is built using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/), and is based on the [Creative Theme for Jekyll](http://startbootstrap.com/template-overviews/creative/) by [Start Bootstrap](http://startbootstrap.com). 

While using the original theme as a base, I’ve customised various aspects of the site, including:

- Modifying the content
- Updating the menu and removing unnecessary sections
- Making adjustments to some of the HTML files and other source code to better fit the project’s needs


## Getting Started

If you’re interested in using or building on this project feel free to do so:
1. Clone the repository.
